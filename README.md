This sample goes hand in hand with a tutorial for the Google Maps Android API:
[Select Current Place and Show Details on a Map](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/current-place-tutorial).

Prerequisites
--------------

- Android SDK v29
- Latest Android Build Tools
- Android Support Repository

Getting started
---------------

This sample uses the Gradle build system.

1. Download the samples by cloning this repository or downloading an archived
  snapshot. (See the options at the top of the page.)
1. In Android Studio, create a new project and choose the "Import non-Android Studio project" or
  "Import Project" option.
1. Select the `CurrentPlaceDetailsOnMap` directory that you downloaded with this repository.
1. If prompted for a gradle configuration, accept the default settings.
  Alternatively use the "gradlew build" command to build the project directly.
1. Add your API key to your app's `gradle.properties` file.
  (For information on getting an API key, see the
  [documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/signup).)
